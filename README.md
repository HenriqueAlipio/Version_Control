# Version_Control

The objective of the work is the implementation of a version control system for a software house. This
system is responsible for managing changes to software projects which include computer programs,
documents, class diagrams, or other artefacts. Changes are identified by a number, termed the ”revision
number”. For example, an initial set of files is ”revision 1”. When the first change is made, the resulting
set is ”revision 2”, and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the employee making
the update. To simplify the development, each project artefact will have its own independent revision
number that starts with the number 1 and is incremented each time the artefact is updated, as discussed
before. Given that some projects developed have confidentiality concerns, in addition to managing
revisions, the system should also ensure that the personnel working on these projects have the necessary
clearance level. The application will support data on the employees, either software developers or project
managers, the projects and their associated artefacts, the definition of project teams of developers, and
the changes/updates made to project artefacts.
